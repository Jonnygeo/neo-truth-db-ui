# 🕸️ Neo Truth DB UI

A lightweight web-based interface for exploring and interacting with the **Neo Truth Database** — a structured archive of scriptural dissection, historical analysis, and exposed manipulations across time, religion, and systems of control.

> “It’s not just a database. It’s a window into what they didn’t want you to see.”

## 🔍 What is This?
